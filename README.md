Pygments SaC Lexer
------------------

This repo provides a Python Pygments plugin to add syntax highlighting for the [1](Single-Assignment C) programming language.

Our lexer extends the Pygments builtin `CLexer` for the C-language.

Usage
=====

Ensure you have `setuptools` available for your preferred version of Python (2 or 3) and the `pygments` package as well. Then in
the repository directory do:

```bash
# to install in your home directory
$ python setup.py install --user
```
